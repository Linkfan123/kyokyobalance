some sort of ttt addon to make weapons feel better and not be stupid

# FAQ

* why is my accuracy decreasing when I fire rapidly

  To make it so people can't M1 as much. I'm gonna tweak it for each weapon so it doesn't make your gun stupidly inacurrate, so feel free to give me feedback so I can do that.

* why is the shotgun less accurate, it was fine before you dick

  Because it was stupidly powerful at medium ranges. Yes, it would be like that in real life, but this is a vidya gamme, it'll be more fun if it was more of a close-range weapon.
  
* why did you buff the HUGE, everyone knows it's a trash weapon so nobody cares about it

  Apparently it has a really high skill ceiling according to a dude I play with sometimes. I decided to buff it to raise the skill floor just enough to encourage people to give a shot at no-lifing it.
